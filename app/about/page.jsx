          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            It all started in a small, sun-drenched village in Kerala, where the aroma of roasting spices and freshly ground coconut filled the air every morning. Our founder, inspired by his grandmother's kitchen—a place where food was a language of love—dreamed of sharing these timeless flavors with the world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The GoldenFork was born from a desire to recreate that authentic experience. From a modest stall serving just chai and vada, we have grown into a culinary destination, but our heart remains the same: rooted in tradition, driven by passion, and dedicated to the art of South Indian hospitality.

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our kitchen is a symphony of rhythm and flavor, led by chefs who have mastered their craft over decades. They don't just cook; they orchestrate a culinary performance. Each member of our team brings a deep respect for traditional techniques, from the precise tempering of mustard seeds to the slow-cooking of our signature biryanis.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that happy hands make delicious food. That's why our team is more than just staff—we are a family, united by a shared love for feeding people and seeing the joy on their faces with every bite.

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "The Guest is God." This ancient Sanskrit verse is the cornerstone of our service. At GoldenFork, we don't just serve food; we serve memories. We believe in the sanctity of fresh ingredients, sourcing our spices directly from farmers in the Western Ghats and our vegetables from local growers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We are committed to sustainability and authenticity. No shortcuts, no artificial preservatives—just pure, wholesome food prepared with the same care and devotion as a meal cooked at home. This is our promise to you.
